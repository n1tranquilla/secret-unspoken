My name is Nathan and I'm a web developer, and husband, and a father. It is wonderful to have the support of my family in speaking out about issues that have touched us. 

Part of the enjoyment of this blog has been the opportunity to use new technology. For you tech people I am using [Gatsby](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/) for this blog. 

I'm looking forward to connecting with you guys and hearing your feedback

Here are some things I'm into lately:
* [The Dismantle Podcast](https://soundcloud.com/user-605044508)
* [Build Wealth Canada](http://www.buildwealthcanada.ca/)
* [Parenting With Love and Logic](https://www.loveandlogic.com/)

You can find me on
